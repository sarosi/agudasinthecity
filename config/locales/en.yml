    main_h1:   "Our Shul"
    paragraph: "Our Shul in Grünangergasse is the only Orthodox Shul in the Center of Vienna, which is in 
                Full-Service through the whole year. It is only a few minutes away from Stephansplatz, in a quiet side-street
                and has a unique Charme, which is hard to describe, but easy to realize immediatelly when a person enters the Shul.
                The “Grünangergasse” is part of Agudas Israel, and its doors are open for anyone who is interested. Our Shul has 
                a personal and warm atmosphere. Here a lonely traveller stays very rarely without an invitation for a Shabbes-meal."

    eruv_paragraph: "Almost the whole city of Vienna is surrounded by an eruv, which is accepted by ALL the Orthodox rabbinates! 
                     Obviously the whole center on Vienna including “Grünangergasse” is inside the eruv. For more informations about the eruv "
